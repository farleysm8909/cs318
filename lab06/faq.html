<h3>I purchased my copy of Windows through a university. Can I download it here?</h3>
    <p class="answer">Yes, but youâ€™ll need your product key. Go to the Academic Products download page and select the version of Windows to begin.</p>
<h3>How do I find my Windows product key?</h3>
    <p class="answer">
    The product key is located inside the product packaging, on the receipt or confirmation page for a digital purchase or in a confirmation e-mail that shows you purchased Windows. If you purchased a digital copy from Microsoft Store, you can locate your product key in your Account under Digital Content.
